# About This Site

*House Stories* is produced by Nicole Haglund.

This website acts as the digital accompaniment to the physical signs mounted near the mentioned homes. The project was inspired after a visit to the Krannert Art Museumâ€™s exhibit on Midcentury Modern homes in the Champaign-Urbana area featuring the [Erlanger House](https://kam.illinois.edu/margaret-erlanger-house). This sparked the idea that there are countless interesting tidbits and stories about the neighborhood. The project aims to make this information more accessible with the community.

The website is developed by [Andrew Haglund](https://haglund.app/) and the [code is open source](https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/urbanastories).
