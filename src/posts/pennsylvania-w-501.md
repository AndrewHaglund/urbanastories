Is the former home of [Larry Smarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Smarr), who was the first director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (or [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/)) and paved the way for modern Internet. 

In his free time he installed an indoor hot tub and wine cellar in the house (both of which have since beenÂ removed).
